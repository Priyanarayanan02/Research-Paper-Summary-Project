           Social Media and the Risk of Poor Mental Health 
                             Among Young Adults

Initial Prompt: General Summary
Prompt: Summarize the key findings of the research paper "Social Media and the Risk of Poor Mental Health Among Young Adults."
Description: This prompt aims to elicit a concise overview of the main points and conclusions presented in the research paper.
Generated Summary: The research paper explores the relationship between social media use and mental health among young adults. It finds that excessive social media use can increase the risk of mental health issues like depression, anxiety, and loneliness. Factors contributing to this include sedentary behavior, poor sleep patterns, cyberbullying, and neglecting real-life interactions. However, the paper also notes that social media can have positive effects, such as providing social support and opportunities for connection.




Iteration 1: Focused on Risk Factors
Prompt: What are the primary factors contributing to the increased risk of mental health issues among young adults who use social media excessively, as discussed in the research paper?
Description: This prompt focuses on identifying the specific factors that the research paper identifies as being particularly harmful to mental health when social media is used excessively.
Generated Summary: The research identifies several key factors that contribute to the increased risk of mental health issues among young adults who use social media excessively. These factors include: sedentary behavior, poor sleep patterns, cyberbullying, and neglecting real-life interactions.

Iteration 2: Implications for Mental Health Professionals
Prompt: Based on the research findings, what strategies can mental health professionals implement to address the negative effects of social media on young adults' mental health?
Description: This prompt directs the summary to consider the practical applications of the research findings for mental health professionals.
Generated Summary: The research suggests that mental health professionals can play a crucial role in addressing the negative effects of social media on young adults' mental health. They can:
	Educate young adults about the potential risks and benefits of social media use.
	Encourage healthy social media habits by promoting balanced use and limiting screen time.
	Provide support and resources for young adults struggling with mental health issues related to social media.
	Advocate for policies that promote responsible social media use and protect young adults from online harm.

Iteration 3: Comparison with Other Studies
Prompt: How do the findings of this research paper compare to previous studies on the relationship between social media and mental health among young adults?
Description: This prompt encourages the summary to consider the context of the research by comparing its findings to those of other studies in the same field.
Generated Summary: While the research paper provides valuable insights into the relationship between social media and mental health among young adults, it's important to note that this is just one study. More research is needed to establish a definitive link between social media use and mental health issues. However, the findings of this study are consistent with previous research that has linked excessive social media use to increased risk of mental health problems.

Final Prompt: Future Research Directions
Prompt: What are the potential areas for future research to further explore the impact of social media on young adults' mental health?
Description: This prompt asks the summary to look beyond the current research and suggest potential avenues for future investigation.
